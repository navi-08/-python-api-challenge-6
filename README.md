Your analysis and linear regression plots for Temperature vs. Latitude in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres are well presented. Here's a summary of the findings for each hemisphere:

Northern Hemisphere:

The linear regression analysis indicates a strong negative correlation between temperature and latitude in the northern hemisphere.
The high r-value (0.766) suggests a robust linear relationship between temperature and latitude, with temperatures dropping as cities in the northern hemisphere move closer to the north pole and farther from the equator.
The scatterplot and regression line clearly illustrate this negative correlation.
Southern Hemisphere:

The linear regression analysis indicates a slight positive correlation between temperature and latitude in the southern hemisphere.
The r-value (0.529) suggests a relatively weaker linear relationship compared to the northern hemisphere, but it still supports a positive correlation.
The scatterplot and regression line demonstrate that temperatures tend to rise as some cities in the southern hemisphere move closer to the equator.
Your analysis provides a clear and accurate interpretation of the linear relationships between temperature and latitude in both hemispheres. The high r-value in the northern hemisphere indicates a strong correlation, while the positive r-value in the southern hemisphere suggests a milder, yet still significant, positive correlation between temperature and latitude. This is consistent with our understanding of how temperature varies with latitude and proximity to the equator.
